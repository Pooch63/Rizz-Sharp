# Basic features

Let's learn printing, variables and logic in Rizz#.

## Printing

In Rizz#, use `alpha` to print. It's important to know that printing is an operator, not a function.
Printing is the alpha male -- it's better than a function.

```text title="prog.rizzler"
// highlight-start
alpha "Hello world!";
// highlight-end
```

## Creating variables

Use the syntax `fanum_tax VAR_NAME be VAR_VALUE` to fanum tax some memory allocation from the interpreter.

```text title = "prog.rizzler"
// highlight-start
fanum_tax text be "Hello world!";
// highlight-end
alpha text;
```

:::info
Only **true** sigmas can understand Rizz#.

## If Statement

Don't be a bitch. Real alpha males are assertive. Forget the `if`s and `else`s.

`bet` on something, and if you happen to be `delulu` about all the alternatives, you're
calling straight `cap`.

```text title="prog.rizzler"
fanum_tax v be 1;
// highlight-start
bet (v fr 2) {
// highlight-end
  alpha "v is 2";
}
// highlight-start
delulu (v cappin 3) {
// highlight-end
  alpha "v is not 3 and it's not 2";
}
// highlight-start
cap {
// highlight-end
  alpha "who tf cares what v is";
}
```

Outputs

```text
v is not 3 and it's not 2
```

Notice the paradigm shift: we aren't writing goddamn hieroglyphics anymore. No one knows what `==` and `!=`
means, but anyone with a functioning pulse knows that `v cappin 3`.

## Switch

We here at Rizz# LLC don't know **who** decided to name `switch` statements, but we do know they are
_total_ beta males. Amp up that aura with the new and improved `looksmaxxing` feature of Rizz#.

```text title="prog.rizzler"
fanum_tax value be 1 + 2 * 3;
// highlight-start
looksmaxxing (value) {
  aura 1:
    alpha "It's 1.";
    dip;
  aura 5:
  aura 6:
    alpha "Notice how you can stack cases like normal";
  aura 7:
    alpha "And, even though value is 6, we didn't break, so this executes.";
    dip;
  what_the_sigma:
    alpha "And this would be the default";
    dip;
}
// highlight-end
```

Outputs

```text
Notice how you can stack cases like normal
And, even though value is 6, we didn't break, so this executes.
```

In case you're a goddamn beta and didn't understand what just happened (in which case
you shouldn't be here anyway), here's what all those terms translate to in C/JavaScript:

| Rizz#            | Beta Language |
| ---------------- | ------------- |
| `looksmaxxing`   | `switch`      |
| `aura`           | `case`        |
| `dip`            | `break`       |
| `what_the_sigma` | `default`     |
