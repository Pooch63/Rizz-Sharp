# Let's Start with Rizz Sharp

## Getting Started

You can download Rizz# with

```shell
npm install rizz-sharp
```

If you do, you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 18.0 or above:
- When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

Alternatively, go to the [playground](https://pooch63.github.io/rizz/playground) to test the language out.

## Running a program

Using TypeScript, run the program with

```typescript
import { run } from "@pooch63/rizz-sharp";

const output = run(`
fanum_tax v be 1;
alpha (v be 3);
`);
if (output.error != null) {
  throw new Error(done.error);
}
```

We'll see what `fanum_tax` and `alpha` mean, and way more, in the next sections.

### Files

Rizz# files follow the `.rizzler` extension, which stands for **RIZZL**anguag**ER**untime.
