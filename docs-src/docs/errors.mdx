# Errors

Sometimes, even we sigmas mess up. You might get a runtime error you need to deal with. It happens.

Here's an example:

```text title="prog.rizzler"
fanum_tax value be 1;
// highlight-start
alpha vlue;
// highlight-end
```

The runtime doesn't know what the hell `vlue` means, so it throws an error. If you want to handle this error
on your own, we can `cringe` out of some `sus`sybacka code:

```text title="prog.rizzler"
// highlight-start
sus {
// highlight-end
    alpha (this_variable_doesnt_exist);
// highlight-start
} cringe (err) {
// highlight-end
    alpha "No shit. " + err;
}
```

Outputs

```text
No shit. Error: Variable "this_variable_doesnt_exist" doesn't exist.
```

:::warning
Lowkey, using `sus cringe` blocks in production code is honestly kinda cringe.

Or, maybe we need to throw an error and then catch it later.
Let's `yeet` an issue at the `cringe` block:

```text title="prog.rizzler"
sus {
    yeet "This is a user-defined error.";
} cringe (err) {
    alpha "Some kind of error occurred, ig";
}
```

Outputs

```text
Some kind of error occurred, ig
```
